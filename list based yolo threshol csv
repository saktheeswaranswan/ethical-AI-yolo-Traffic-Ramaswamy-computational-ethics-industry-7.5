now understand my logic properly write a python  code in yolo object detection yolov3-tiny.weights,yolov3-tiny.cfg,coco.names now take some class from coco.names and put it in a list and only crop those in live web cam feed and save the full video in a folder and save the time stamp the images where cropped in  threshold in list comparing the order for 80 class   in list and crop the images as threshold given mili seconds to the order in crop images list and time stamp of the time of crop images at live web cam feed in separate a csv with cuda inference and nms and best hershly simplex best algorithm
